# example definition of a more complex json configuration files to mount it into the docker container via
# helm chart - everything from the "local_production_json" key is written into the configmap generated by helm
# and mounted as a file into the container from the configmap
#
# The data are written as file "local-production-docker.json" to not overwrite the file "local-production.json"
# that gets create from within the docker startup script. Redis commander first evaluates the "local-production.json"
# and afterward "local-production-docker.json"  - keys defined here overwrite settings from "local-production.json".
#
# this example defines all data to write into the "local-production-docker.json" file as YAML object
# this YAML is converted into JSON before writing it into the docker container as JSON config file
